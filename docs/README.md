# IPFS2: Web3 IPFS Gateway

IPFS2 is a proof-of-concept ENS Resolver capable of resolving IPFS/IPNS contenthash and records as subdomains of a parent name, and render associated ABI-encoded records when queried via a URL. Several centralised IPFS content providers offer IPFS/IPNS resolution of the form `https://<hash>.dweb.link` â†’ `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<hash>` (or similar). IPFS2 is a similar service with off-chain centralised resolvers replaced with on-chain resolvers. IPFS2 Resolver also supports additional features such as querying `data` records associated with the (ENS) contenthash in [RFC-8615](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615) compatible URL format.

## Query Syntax

To resolve `<data>` content stored at IPFS `<hash>`, i.e. `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<hash>/.well-known/<data>.json`, URL query is formatted as:

```
https://<hash>.ipfs2.eth.*/.well-known/<data>.json
```

# Description

`IPFS2.eth` is a dual implementation of CCIP-Read 'Off-chain Lookup', in which the Resolver contract is capable of fulfilling two queries simultaneously,

- to fetch the ENS contenthash as the parent domain's subdomain, and
- to fetch the RFC-8615 compliant records stored at that contenthash, if requested.

IPFS2 currently supports `eth.limo`, `eth.casa` and `eth.link` as ENS gateways and is designed to accept new gateways.

## Design

IPFS2 architecture is as follows:
